I need to work with how the function invokes cards and everything.  Right now when I load the page, random cards are
generated.  Then every iteration of clicking the button loads the cards that were generated upon page loading.

Instead I need to move to:
// 1. Click start button
// 2. Generate 2 random cards
// 3. Run the logic to display appropriate message



Going back to do a quick rehash just to log everything in GitHub

Okay, I did a ton, another 30 minutes at the PC.

I'm going to try and import it into here from my Drive and update everything
