Pushing to arrays.  I created a new file to work with arrays.  I need to really just follow the lead of this project,
because I was working to create the logic my way that made the game function as you'd expect, but I was doing it with 
several functions.  I have to reign it in for now, and just follow along to meet the DLO's.



Currently have the blackjack program in a place I'm very happy.
It starts the game, displays cards and current sum, allows you to hit,
and will stop the game once you bust or hit blackjack.  

Also, clicking start game will reset the game and allow you to play again.

The tutorial wants me to move my cards into an array and display them from there though.  
Currently I'm simply taking the Cards element and += hitCard onto the end, rather than
adding hitCard to an array, then using that array as the display, but I'm guessing he's going 
to have us populate and array, then use a loop to itterate each card inside the array into our
cards element to teach arrays and loops.  

So I should probably try following the array methodology.  I want to first see how to create a fork
because I would like to retain my original work and concept of how I was going about solving this.
